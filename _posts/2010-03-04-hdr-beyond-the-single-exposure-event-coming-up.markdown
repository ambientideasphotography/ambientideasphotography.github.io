Just a another quick note to everyone that my "HDR, Beyond the Single Exposure" talk is coming up soon. If you can, come by the Highlands Ranch library on March 9, 2010. Details about time and location are available on the <a href="http://www.hrphotoclub.com/" target="_blank">HR Photo Club web site here</a>.

Don't forget, we also have an amazing product giveaway as well!
