<p style="text-align: left;">Wrapped up the week photographing a recent kitchen remodel and captured some amazing shots during this early morning session. Denver just had a snowstorm, so the details outside, including the trees and foliage were rather bright, but this just amplified the flood of gorgeous natural light into the room. Check out this one shot from the session.</p>
