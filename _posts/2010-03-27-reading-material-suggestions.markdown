Rarely do I come across a book that really grabs my attention, and with so many photography books out there, it's sometimes difficult to come across one that really approaches a topic that hasn't already been covered. Dan Margulis' "Photoshop LAB Color" is one of those attention-grabbers.

From the first chapter of no-thinking-required effort to make an image pop to advanced color correction and masking, this is <em>the </em>book to read for any advanced amateur or professional photographer.

Although Photoshop CS5 is just Â around the corner, even this text, which was published in 2005, has a serious place on my bookshelf with tricks and techniques that apply through just about any recent version of Adobe Photoshop.
