I'm back! After two trips and days of being on a plane, at long last I am back stateside and in the office. The trips have been wonderful, and everything on the photo agenda was accomplished as planned. This is just a quick post, and a more in-depth entry and info on some photo techniques will be coming soon. For now, enjoy this shot of St. Patrick's Cathedral from Dublin, Ireland.
