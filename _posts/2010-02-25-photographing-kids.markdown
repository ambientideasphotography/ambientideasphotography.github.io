<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-46" title="Children's Portraiture" src="http://ambientideasphotography.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/20100224-Kramarczyk-11.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />Today I had the opportunity to photograph some kids--and in this case, twins! Â During the session, it came down to capturing the kiddos in soft, diffused window light.

Well, these guys were quick, so setting up a full strobe-lit scenario wouldn't provide the flexible and comfortable environment for capturing them in action. Additionally, a photographer with a big scary looking camera and chasing them about from grown-up height just wasn't going to get it!

So here's a tip for anyone capturing pictures of kids--come down to their level and the whole scenario changes. If that means crawling on the floor, playing peek-a-boo with the camera around the sofa--whatever it takes--the more fun it is for the subject, the better the expressions and final images are going to be. And most of all, the expressions will be authentic and show the personality of the model.
