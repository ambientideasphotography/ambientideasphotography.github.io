I'm finally back in the office with enough time to post this quick entry and some shots from this week's recent sessions. The photos below were from a gorgeous home that was perfectly staged. Everything just worked out--the lighting, the layout, etc.

If you attended my HDR talk last month, you might recall that I use HDR techniques extensively for my real estate imagery. 1) This provides me with a solution to blowing highlights or clipping shadows 2) Avoids the hassle for both the client/home owner Â and myself of dragging in a bunch of lighting equipment.

HDR images don't have to possess the "HDR look" and can be quite effective at pulling detail where needed, or avoiding clipping in undesirable aspects. Here are three examples below (higher resolution shots and some more details to come later this week!).

Enjoy...
